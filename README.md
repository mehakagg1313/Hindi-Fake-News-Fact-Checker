Hindi Fake News Dataset and Analysis
--
we have tried to extend the automation of data annotation to Hindi. This research concentrates on automating the task of identifying the links that lead to fake news and annotating it accordingly using a machine learning model. A manually annotated Hindi Fake News links dataset was used for training the model which works on algorithms such as Gaussian Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine, LSTM and others. On a benchmark dataset consisting of 932 fake and 1274 not-fake news links, the model has been successful in identifying most of the fake news links and we achieved an accuracy of 82.35% for the Random Forest model implemented on 10% test data  and an accuracy of 60.42% for the LSTM model implemented on 30% test data.
